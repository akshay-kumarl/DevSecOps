Whether it's code, infrastructure, or configuration files, version control is critical. Make sure to version your changes.

𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗜/𝗖𝗗 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 ⚠️
Start with a simple, streamlined CI/CD pipeline, then scale it as needed, focusing on essential automation.

𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 (𝗜𝗮𝗖) 🏗️
Manually provisioning infrastructure leads to inconsistencies and errors. Always use IaC tools like Terraform or Ansible to automate and standardize infrastructure setups.

Incorporate security checks like static analysis, dependency scanning, and container security (e.g., Trivy) into your CI/CD pipeline to avoid any vulnerabilities in ur piprline.

𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘀 🛑
Never store sensitive information (API keys, passwords) directly in code. Use secret management tools like Vault or Kubernetes Secrets to manage credentials securely.

𝗜𝗴𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁𝘀 📊
 Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack to get 
insights into application performance and quickly address issues.

𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗖𝗜/𝗖𝗗 ❌
Deploying without proper testing (unit, integration, security) in the CI/CD pipeline increases the chances of failures. Make sure tests are automated and run at every stage.

𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲𝘀 ⚙️
Poor resource allocation (e.g., memory, CPU limits) in cloud or Kubernetes environments can lead to performance issues or wasted resources.

Regularly back up critical data and infrastructure configurations, and ensure there's a tested recovery process in place.

𝗡𝗲𝗴𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 📝
Lack of clear, updated documentation for processes, infrastructure, and configurations makes onboarding and troubleshooting difficult.
